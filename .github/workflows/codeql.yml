# ===========================================
# CODEQL ANALYSIS FEATURES
# ===========================================

# ✅ Detects common security vulnerabilities:
#    - Command injection (like we fixed in generate-commit.js)
#    - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
#    - SQL injection
#    - Path traversal
#    - Unsafe deserialization
#    - Hard-coded credentials

# ✅ Runs automatically on:
#    - Every push to main/develop branches
#    - Every pull request to main/develop
#    - Weekly scheduled scan (Mondays 6 AM)

# ✅ Integration:
#    - Results appear in Security tab
#    - Failed checks block PR merges (if configured)
#    - SARIF files uploaded for analysis
#    - Compatible with VS Code extension

# ===========================================
# CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
# ===========================================

# Query Packs:
# - security-extended: Focus on security vulnerabilities
# - security-and-quality: Security + code quality issues
# - Default queries: Basic analysis only

# Additional Languages:
# Add to matrix.language array as your project grows:
# - 'python' (if you add Python scripts)
# - 'typescript' (for .ts files)

# Build Steps:
# For compiled languages, add build commands between init and analyze steps
