# Configuration Notes:
# - Security updates are ALWAYS enabled regardless of schedule
# - Weekly schedule reduces notification noise vs daily
# - Monday 9am timing avoids weekend notifications
# - Limited PRs prevent overwhelming your inbox
# - Conventional commit prefixes match your existing style
# - Labels help organize and filter Dependabot PRs
